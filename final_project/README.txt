How to Play
-----------
In the bottom right hand side of your screen you will see your remaining mana/total mana
Mana is used for playing cards. To play a card you must have remaining mana greater than or
equal to the cost of the card.  The cost of a card is displayed in the upper left-hand corner 
of each card.  When you play a card, its cost is subtracted from your remaining mana. You can play
multiple cards in one turn if you have enough mana.

After a card is played, you must wait until the start of the next turn to attack with it.
When a card turns red this indicates that it is ready to attack. You can either attack an enemy card
by clicking your card, which will turn yellow to indicate that you have selected it for an attack,
and then clicking the card you want to attack or you can press the "Attack!" button on the right
side of the screen to cause all cards that are avilable to attack the enemy player, subtracting from
the enemies health on the left side of your screen. The goal of the game is to get your opponents
health down to 0 before your health reaches 0.  If you attack an opponents card, then both
cards will damage each other according to their attack values(on the lower left-hand side of the
card). If the enemy does more damage than your card's health(lower right hand-side of the card),
the card will be removed from the board.

Cards also have abilities, which you can see when you hover over a card. Abilities either start with
the term "Battlecry", meaning the ability will proc when the card is set on the board, or 
"Deathrattle", meaning the card's ability will proc when the card is removed from the board.
When an ability is available to use, red text will appear in the middle of the screen, showing
the ability that is available and prompting you to select an appropriate card to use it on.
The "Taunt" ability is a special case.  If a card has Taunt then the enemy is required to attack
this minion before anything else.
